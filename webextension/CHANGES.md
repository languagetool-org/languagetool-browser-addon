# LanguageTool WebExtension Change Log

### 1.0.24 (2017-09-29)
  * Internal preparation for upcoming features
  * Tracking fixes
  
### 1.0.23 (2017-09-28)
  * commented out error logging to avoid excessive logging of 'unknown error event'
    to Piwik
  
### 1.0.22 (2017-09-28)
  * An icon is now shown in the lower right corner of the text box the user is typing in,
    to remind them the add-on exists. Text is not checked automatically but only when
    clicking on the icon. There are a few sites where the icon is not shown, e.g. Facebook.
    (https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool-browser-addon/issues/46)
  * Some typography-related rules are now turned off by default because they are not useful
    in a web context for most users (only affects new installations or those that haven't
    saved any rule turn on/off yet)
    (https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool/issues/798)
  * Added French translation

### 1.0.21 (2017-09-11)
  * Show "no text found" message if no text could be found, as it also
    happens in Collabora Office
    (https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool-browser-addon/issues/115)

### 1.0.20 (2017-08-28)
  * improvements to keyboard-only usage
  * tracking manual language switching so we can see for which language pairs the
    automatic detection doesn't work well

### 1.0.19 (2017-08-23)
  * Chrome only: the add-on can now be used with the keyboard only. Use
    cursor up/down to navigate to an error, use cursor right/left to
    select a suggestion and `Return` to apply a suggestion.
    (https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool-browser-addon/issues/109)
  * Tracking fixes
  
### 1.0.18 (2017-08-19)
  * Tracking: we now also track opening the options dialog to understand
    how many users change their settings
  
### 1.0.15, 1.0.16, 1.0.17 (2017-07-30)
  * Track unique users and actions like 'apply suggestion' - your IP address still
    isn't logged and we cannot identify you.
    Anyway, you can opt-out at https://languagetool.org/privacy/
  
### 1.0.14 (2017-07-19)
  * add some tracking via Piwik - your IP address still isn't logged and you can
    opt-out at https://languagetool.org/privacy/
  
### 1.0.13 (2017-02-28)
  * make saving options work with Firefox 52 and later
  * show a proper error message when used on addons.mozilla.org (it's blocked there)
  * conform to Mozilla's code guidelines and make sure that everything
    shown via innerHTML is sanitized for security reasons (using
    https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)
 
### 1.0.11 (2017-02-01)
  * ask users for a review in the popup if they have used
    the extension at least 30 times (Chrome only) 

### 1.0.10 (2017-01-28)
  * make it work with Firefox 52 and later
    (https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool-browser-addon/issues/97)

### 1.0.9 (2016-12-03)
  * bugfix for Firefox 50: hovering over the rule/spelling icons
    made the content of the popup suddenly scroll up

### 1.0.7 (2016-11-17)
  * bugfix for visual improvements introduced in previous version

### 1.0.6 (2016-11-14)

  * further improvements for error logging
  * fix some cases of replacements not working, e.g. in the message view
    on upwork.com (#71)
  * applying corrections on facebook.com has been disabled, as it makes
    further edits of the text impossible (#70)

### 1.0.3 (2016-08-22)
  * more data (usage counter and add-on version) get transferred when users
    uninstall the add-on

### 1.0.2 (2016-08-21)
  * some internal errors that cause a text check to fail are now sent to the
    server for better analysis

### 1.0.1 (2016-08-16)

    instead (issue #59)

### 0.9.7 (2016-06-11 for Firefox only)
  * disabled rules now show a number indicating how many more matches there
    will be when the rule gets activated again
